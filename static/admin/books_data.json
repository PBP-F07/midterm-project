It is difficult for many students to master basic concepts in computer science and programming. A large portion of the confusion can be blamed on the complexity of the tools and materials that are traditionally used to teach CS1 and CS2. This textbook was written with a single overarching goal: to present the core concepts of computer science as simply as possible without being simplistic.",

    "description": "This textbook grew out of notes for the ECE143 Programming for Data Analysis class that the author has been teaching at University of California, San Diego, which is a requirement for both graduate and undergraduate degrees in Machine Learning and Data Science. This book is ideal for readers with some Python programming experience. The book covers key language concepts that must be understood to program effectively, especially for data analysis applications. Certain low-level language features are discussed in detail, especially Python memory management and data structures. Using Python effectively means taking advantage of its vast ecosystem. The book discusses Python package management and how to use third-party modules as well as how to structure your own Python modules. The section on object-oriented programming explains features of the language that facilitate common programming patterns. After developing the key Python language features, the book moves on to third-party modules that are foundational for effective data analysis, starting with Numpy. The book develops key Numpy concepts and discusses internal Numpy array data structures and memory usage. Then, the author moves onto Pandas and details its many features for data processing and alignment. Because strong visualizations are important for communicating data analysis, key modules such as Matplotlib are developed in detail, along with web-based options such as Bokeh, Holoviews, Altair, and Plotly. The text is sprinkled with many tricks-of-the-trade that help avoid common pitfalls. The author explains the internal logic embodied in the Python language so that readers can get into the Python mindset and make better design choices in their codes, which is especially helpful for newcomers to both Python and data analysis. To get the most out of this book, open a Python interpreter and type along with the many code samples.",

Now with detailed exercises at the end of every chapter! Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free eBook in PDF format. Key FeaturesLearn how, when, and why to adopt functional elements in your projectsExplore the Python modules essential to functional programming, like itertools and functoolsRevised to cover new features of Python 3.10, exercises at the end of every chapter, and moreBook Description Not enough developers understand the benefits of functional programming, or even what it is. Author Steven Lott demystifies the approach, teaching you how to improve the way you code in Python and make gains in memory use and performance. Starting from the fundamentals, this book shows you how to apply functional thinking and techniques in a range of scenarios, with examples centered around data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. You'll learn how to use generator expressions, list comprehensions, and decorators to your advantage. You don't have to abandon object-oriented design completely, though – you'll also see how Python's native object-orientation is used in conjunction with functional programming techniques. By the end of this book, you'll be well versed in the essential functional programming features of Python, and understand why and when functional thinking helps. You'll also have all the tools you need to pursue any additional functional topics that are not part of the Python language. What you will learnUse Python's libraries to avoid the complexities of state-changing classesLeverage built-in higher-order functions to avoid rewriting common algorithmsWrite generator functions to create lazy processingDesign and implement decorators for functional compositionMake use of Python type annotations to describe parameters and results of functionsApply functional programming to concurrency and web servicesExplore the PyMonad library for stateful simulationsWho this book is for The functional paradigm is very useful for programmers working in data science, but any Python developer who wants to create more reliable, succinct, and expressive code will have much to learn from this book. No prior knowledge of functional programming is required to get started, though Python programming knowledge is assumed. A running Python environment is essential.",
